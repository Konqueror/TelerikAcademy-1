What does the namespaces represents in the XML documents? What are they used for? 

In XML, element names are defined by the developer. This often results in a conflict when trying to mix XML documents from different XML applications.
Name conflicts in XML can easily be avoided using a name prefix.
When using prefixes in XML, a so-called namespace for the prefix must be defined.

The namespace is defined by the xmlns attribute in the start tag of an element.

The namespace declaration has the following syntax. xmlns:prefix="URI".
When a namespace is defined for an element, all child elements with the same prefix are associated with the same namespace.

Namespaces can be declared in the elements where they are used or in the XML root element.
The purpose is to give the namespace a unique name. However, often companies use the namespace as a pointer to a web page containing namespace information.
