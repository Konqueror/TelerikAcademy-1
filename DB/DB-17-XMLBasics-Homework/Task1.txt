What does the XML language represents? What does it used for? 

Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents 
in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. It is defined in the XML 1.0 Specification 
produced by the W3C, and several other related specifications, all free open standards.

The design goals of XML emphasize simplicity, generality, and usability over the Internet.
It is a textual data format with strong support via Unicode for different human languages. 
Although the design of XML focuses on documents, it is widely used 
for the representation of arbitrary data structures, for example in web services.

Many application programming interfaces (APIs) have been developed to aid software 
developers with processing XML data, and several schema systems exist to aid in the definition of XML-based languages.
