* What is the expected running time of the following C# code? Explain why.

long CalcSum(int[,] matrix, int row)
{
    long sum = 0;
    for (int col = 0; col < matrix.GetLength(0); col++) 
        sum += matrix[row, col];
    if (row + 1 < matrix.GetLength(1)) 
        sum += CalcSum(matrix, row + 1);
    return sum;
}

Console.WriteLine(CalcSum(matrix, 0));


Assume the input matrix has size of n * m.

Answer:

The for cycle will be executed n times. (the number of rows).

We will recursivly call the same method again untill the row + 1 < cols of the matrix.

No matter how many times we call this method there is only the for cycle wich will always execute m number of times.

This means that the algorithm still runs in quadratic time O(n*m)
The number of elementary steps is ~ n * m - InitialValueOf row param.
